# Toktok

## Project Overview
Toktok is a React application built with TypeScript. This project serves as a template for creating modern web applications with a focus on type safety and component-based architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 5.6 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Toktok.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Toktok
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` directory containing the optimized application.
